# Personal-Projects
This is where all my personal projects will be added.
This is my first project using a framework called Bootstrap
With this specific project, the aim was to showcase my creativity and also show both my interests in fashion and taking care of myself and using all of that to put it in code.
I utilised this project using HTML, CSS and Bootstrap
